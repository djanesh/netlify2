<p>I have been using the <code>xarinagn</code> package developed by Yihui Xie for a while now and have been using that to create presentations within my company. I really like what <code>xaringan</code> offers to the R users. I had modified the YAML of the <code>markdown</code> page a little so that I could have my own css file and my layout which displays company name and logo at the footer. I was copying and pasting the <code>css</code> file and <code>logo</code> file to all the presentation folder I would create. After sometime of copying and pasting process, I thought to myself that may be somebody has already developed tools for things like this so you can have your own template and that would eliminate this clunky method of copying and pasting to get the desired layout of your presentation.</p>
<p>I went to our old friend Google and asked on how to create a template on RStudio. Then I found out the post written by <code>Chester Ismay</code> which describes the process of creating your own custom template that can be used in Rstudio. I was very excited.</p>
<p>The basic principle behind creating these templates is that you would create a R package and would include <code>skeleton.Rmd</code> , and any files that would be required for that <code>skeleton.Rmd</code> and put in the <code>skeleton</code> folder in the <code>inst</code> folder of the package that you create.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. We can use <code>devtools</code> R package to create a new package for us. Use the following command to create a new package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(knitr)
devtools::create(&quot;DSI Template&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This newly created package would just have bunch of core files such as description, namespace, and R folder. Then the next step is to create <code>inst</code> folder on the root level as <code>R</code> folder and <code>man</code> folder.</p>
<p>I used the following command from Chester’s post to create a <code>skeleton</code> folder which is 5 levels inside the <code>inst</code> folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dir.create(&quot;dsitemplate/inst/rmarkdown/templates/report/skeleton&quot;, recursive = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>So, far we have created a package and created bunch of empty folders. Next step is to create a new <code>Rmd</code> file in <code>Rstudio</code>. You can either copy and paste what you want to include in your <code>Rmd</code> file. In my case I copied the code that I was using in my presentations. The code looked like following:</p>

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>I saved this <code>skeleton.Rmd</code> file in the <code>skeleton</code> folder that we created earlier. Inside the skeleton folder, I copied two other dependent files <code>footer-header.css</code> and <code>logo.png</code> file.</p>
<p>One more thing to do before installing the package on our machine. We need to create a <code>yaml</code> file. This is very important because if we don’t create it, the template would appear in <code>Rstudio</code>.</p>
<p>My <code>template.yaml</code> file looks like following:</p>
<pre><code>name: DSI Template
description: DSI Template
create_dir: true</code></pre>
<p>You can give the same information for <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>. In my case, I have added additional dependent files so I have included another option <code>create_dir: true</code> as well.</p>
<p>Now, we are ready to install this package on our machine. To do so, please follow the code below:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; devtools::install(&quot;dsitemplate&quot;)
Installing dsitemplate
&quot;C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-34~1.3/bin/x64/R&quot; --no-site-file --no-environ --no-save --no-restore --quiet CMD INSTALL &quot;D:/Personal Projects/R  \
  Projects/New folder/template_xaringan/dsitemplate&quot; --library=&quot;C:/Users/DSI/Documents/R/win-library/3.4&quot; --install-tests 

* installing *source* package &#39;dsitemplate&#39; ...
** inst
** help

** testing if installed package can be loaded
*** arch - i386
*** arch - x64
* DONE (dsitemplate)
In R CMD INSTALL</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have installed the package, go ahead and close your Rstudio instance and reopen it. Now, if you click new <code>Rmarkdown</code> and choose <code>From Template</code> you would see the following options:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://snag.gy/ExJ5QN.jpg" alt="Rstudio-Markdown-Template" />
<p class="caption">Rstudio-Markdown-Template</p>
</div>
<p>In my case I should give name in the <code>Name</code> field and it would create a directory with the template R markdown file as well as css and logo file.</p>
<p>This is how I created a template for Rmarkdown and now you can too.</p>
